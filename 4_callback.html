<!--
    A callback function is executed after the current effect is 100% finished.

    -- JavaScript statements are executed line by line. However, with effects,
     the next line of code can be run even though the effect is not finished. This can create errors.
    -- To prevent this, you can create a callback function.
    -- A callback function is executed after the current effect is finished.
      Typical syntax: $(selector).hide(speed,callback);
