<!--  *jQuery Selectors*
jQuery selectors are one of the most important parts of the jQuery library.
jQuery selectors allow you to select and manipulate HTML element(s).
jQuery selectors are used to "find" (or select) HTML elements based on their name, id, classes, types, attributes, values of attributes and much more. 
It's based on the existing CSS Selectors, and in addition, it has some own custom selectors.
All selectors in jQuery start with the dollar sign and parentheses: $().

    /*   *The Document Ready Event*
You might have noticed that all jQuery methods in our examples, are inside a document ready event:
his is to prevent any jQuery code from running before the document is finished loading (is ready).
It is good practice to wait for the document to be fully loaded and ready before working with it.
 This also allows you to have your JavaScript code before the body of your document, in the head section

    */
      $(document).ready(function(){     // this another way to call function.
      $("button").click(function(){
      $("p").hide();                   //When a user clicks on a button, all <p> elements will be hidden:

     *What is an events*
    All the different visitors' actions that a web page can respond to are called events.
   examples:
-moving a mouse over an element
-selecting a radio button
-clicking on an element.
1)click()--The click() method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.
           The function is executed when the user clicks on the HTML element.
2)mouseenter() --The mouseenter() method attaches an event handler function to an HTML element.
                  The function is executed when the mouse pointer enters the HTML element:
3)hover()--The hover() method takes two functions and is a combination of the mouseenter() and mouseleave() method.
4)focus()--The focus() method attaches an event handler function to an HTML form field.
           The function is executed when the form field gets focus:e.g to do text box colour when we click.
5)on()-Add one more event.
